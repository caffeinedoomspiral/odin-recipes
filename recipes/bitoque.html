            <p class="desc">The traditional portuguese "bitoque" is one of the staples of portuguese cuisine, and will feature the menus of every portuguese tavern worth its salt. There are countless iterations of this dish, but the base is always the same: the steak, the fried egg, the fries and the sauce with lots of garlic. This filling meal is best enjoyed with a cold beer and a slice of bread to dip in the sauce.</p>
