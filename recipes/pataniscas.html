    <p>This is a very versatile typical portuguese dish, that'll certainly be a lovely addition to christmas dinners and summer afternoons alike. Light and savoury, it goes hand in hand with a cold beer, accompanied with some salad, or a nice tomato or red bean rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients <em>(2 pax)</em></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cod Steak <em>(previously soaked)</em>;</li>
        <li>15ml of Olive Oil;</li>
        <li>1 small Onion;</li>
        <li>120g of Wheat Flour;</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>1 Lemon</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Carefully remove the skin and bones from the cod, and then shred it into flakes. Place the codfish into a bowl;</li>
        <li>Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl;</li>
        <li>Pour the milk over the cod until it almost covers it completely;</li>
        <li>Nicely coat the cod with the milk and then cover the bowl with cling film. Let it rest for 2 hours;</li>
        <li>Place the flour, the egg, the olive oil, the finely chopped onion and finely chopped parsley into a bowl, and add salt and pepper to taste. Mix the ingredients together to make the batter. <em>Pro tip: You can add a bit of the water in which you soaked the cod to add some flavour</em>;</li>
        <li>Drain the cod flakes and add them to the batter. Mix them well;</li>
        <li>Heat up the oil and deep fry the battered cod until golden brown;</li>
        <li>Season with some salt and garnish with some parsley. Serve and enjoy!</li>
