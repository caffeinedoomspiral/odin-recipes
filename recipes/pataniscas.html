        <p>This is a very versatile typical portuguese dish, that'll certainly be a lovely addition to christmas dinners and summer afternoons alike. Light and savoury, it goes hand in hand with a cold beer, accompanied with some salad, or a nice tomato or red bean rice.</p>

            <li>Carefully remove the skin and bones from the cod, and then shred it into flakes. Place the codfish into a bowl;</li>
            <li>Cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl;</li>
            <li>Pour the milk over the cod until it almost covers it completely;</li>

            <li>Place the flour, the egg, the olive oil, the finely chopped onion and finely chopped parsley into a bowl, and add salt and pepper to taste.

            <li>Drain the cod flakes and add them to the batter. Mix them well;</li>
            <li>Heat up the oil and deep fry the battered cod until golden brown;</li>
